I've been following Fawlty Enterprises' progress with the potential sale of Fawlty Towers, and understand you're aiming for a sale in 2026/27 to help fund your well-deserved retirement in the Mediterranean \u2013 a lovely vision!\n\nGiven recent market feedback suggesting a sale price potentially below your initial expectations, proactively planning for Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is more important than ever. Maximizing Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR) will be key to protecting your funds, especially with potential price adjustments. The rules surrounding BADR are also subject to change, so acting now is prudent.\n\nI estimate that with careful planning, we could potentially save you \u00a340,000 - \u00a360,000+ in tax. I'd be happy to discuss strategies tailored to your situation, even considering Sybil's input on timing.\n\nWould you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week to explore this further?\n\nBest Regards,\nYour Financial Advisor.",
