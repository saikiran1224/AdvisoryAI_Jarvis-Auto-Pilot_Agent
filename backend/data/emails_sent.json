I understand you\u2019re keen to achieve a strong sale price, and I appreciate that can be a delicate balance.\n\nGiven the current market and the timing of your planned sale, I wanted to proactively discuss potential Capital Gains Tax (CGT) planning strategies. With Fawlty Towers qualifying as a trading business, you may be eligible for Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR) at a rate of 10% \u2013 a significant benefit. However, maximizing this relief, and minimizing your overall CGT liability, requires careful planning, especially as the legislation is subject to review.\n\nWe could potentially save you \u00a330,000 - \u00a350,000+, or even more, depending on the final sale price and your BADR qualification. Would you be open to a brief 20-minute call next week to explore these options?\n\nBest Regards,\nYour Financial Advisor.",
