    "body": "Dear Basil,\n\nI hope this email finds you well.\n\nI've been following the market for hotels like Fawlty Towers, and understand you're aiming for a sale price around \u00a31.2 million. While that's a commendable goal, current feedback suggests a realistic range might be \u00a31.2 - \u00a31.3 million. \n\nWith the potential sale on the horizon, I wanted to reach out regarding Capital Gains Tax planning. Given Fawlty Towers operates as a trading business, you likely qualify for Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR), potentially reducing your CGT rate to just 10%. However, proactive planning is key, especially with potential legislative changes.\n\nWe could explore strategies to minimize your tax liability and maximize your BADR benefits, potentially saving you \u00a330,000 - \u00a350,000 or more. Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week to discuss this further? \n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\n[Your Firm]",
